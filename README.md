# Cuber
### Overview:
An endless-runner built with the **Unity Game Development Engine** where a player must dodge incoming obstacles and try to survive for as long as possible. To keep the game difficult, the blocks get faster over time. The scripts for the game were written with **C#** and the assets were built in the **Unity Game Development Engine**.

### Features:
- **Randomly generated** static and moving obstacles to keep the playing experience fresh
- Score tracking system at the top of the screen
- After hitting an obstacle time is slowed to allow the player to see how they lost
